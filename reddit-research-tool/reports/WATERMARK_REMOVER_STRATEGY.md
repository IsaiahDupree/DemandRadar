**No subscriptions for occasional users** - This directly addresses the #1 pain point discovered in research.

### Recommended Pricing Model: Credit-Based Pay-As-You-Go

| Tier | Price | Credits | Per Image | Best For |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Try** | Free | 3 | $0.00 | First-time users from ads |

| **Pro Pack** | $15 | 60 | $0.25 | Regular freelancers |
| **Agency** | $39 | 200 | $0.20 | Heavy users, agencies |

### Why This Works
- ✅ No subscription = removes biggest objection
- ✅ Credits never expire = no pressure to use
- ✅ Low entry point ($5) = easy first purchase
- ✅ Volume discounts = rewards loyal users
- ✅ Free tier = frictionless ad conversion

### Price Comparison (Your Advantage)
| Scenario | Stock Subscription | Your Tool |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Need 5 images once | $29/mo (forced) | $5 one-time |
| Need 20 images/month | $29-49/mo | $15 one-time |
| Need 5 images/year | $348/year minimum | $5 total |
