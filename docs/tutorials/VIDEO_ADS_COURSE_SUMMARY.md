## The Two Biggest Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Reinventing the Wheel
- Don't try to create completely original ad concepts from scratch
- When starting out, minimize variables that keep you from making money
- Don't make ads based on what you *think* will convert

**Instead:** Look at what's already working and add your own unique twist

### Mistake #2: Ripping Content
- Don't steal ads one-for-one from competitors
- Facebook saves **metadata** on every ad (specific data associated with images/videos)
- Facebook can detect stolen content and will:
  - Shut down your ad account
  - Reject the ad
  - Completely restrict you from advertising
- In 2025, AI is also used to detect stolen content

## The 4-Step Process for Winning Ads

### Step 1: Swipe
Find pre-existing creatives that you can prove with data are converting at scale.

**Key Principle:** Don't reinvent the wheel - find what's already working

**How to Swipe:**
1. Use ad spy tools (like Hookd) to find winning ads
2. Look for ads with high engagement and long run times
3. Identify the core concept/angle being used
4. Note the structure, hook, and call-to-action

### Step 2: Script
Create your own version of the winning concept with original content.

**Script Structure:**
1. **Hook** (first 3 seconds) - Stop the scroll
2. **Problem** - Identify the pain point
3. **Solution** - Introduce your product
4. **Benefits** - Show what they'll gain
5. **Social Proof** - Reviews, testimonials, results
6. **CTA** - Clear call to action

### Step 3: Shoot
Film your own original content based on the script.

**Tips:**
- Use UGC (User Generated Content) style
- Authentic, relatable content performs best
- Good lighting and audio matter
- Multiple angles and b-roll footage

### Step 4: Scale
Test and scale the winning creatives.

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Start with small budgets to test
- Double down on winners
- Kill losers quickly
- Iterate on what works
