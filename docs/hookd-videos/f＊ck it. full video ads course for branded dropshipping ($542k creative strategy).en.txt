hey guys Mark here in this video I'm going to show you how to make high converting ads for your brand and drop shipping business that have made me over $542,000 the biggest mistake that I see people make is actually twofold the first biggest mistake that they make is they try to reinvent the wheel right and this is one of the worst things that you can do because if you're just starting out you want to minimize the variables that you have that are keeping you from making money and one of those variables is trying to just make ads that you think are going to convert don't think okay you want to look at what is already working and simply add your own unique twist to it right take the concepts that are already working for other people and then make them work for yourself and the second mistake that I see people make that just drives me crazy is they try to rip content meaning they'll finding ads and Performing and they'll literally steal it one for one now this is a terrible terrible strategy because dating all the way back to when Facebook ads starts if you rip somebody's content Facebook will be able to tell they save something on your ad called metadata and metadata is specific data associated with the image or video ad that you're running so Facebook sees that you stole somebody's ad all they'll do is shut down your ad account reject the ad or worse just completely restrict you from advertising altogether and now fast forward the 2025 they're using AI to do this as well so even if you try to get around the metadata policies if they see that you're using stolen content it's just a terrible way to get your brand off the ground and you're putting yourself at a lot of risk so what we're going to do instead is a simple four step process to create winning ads okay step number one is going to be to swipe and what swiping is is simply finding a pre-existing creative that you can already prove with data is converting at scale right you don't want to reinvent the wheels you want to take the concept of ads that are already working and simply apply those to your brand the Second Step that you're going to do is actually script the ad this is probably the most important thing when it comes to making high converting ads is the script meaning the hook the body and the call to action every single ad in the history a planet earth has those three elements that you can break them down into sub elements but every single one has a hook which is the first 3 to 5 Seconds of the ad there's the body section and then there's a call to action to actually get people to click so that's going to be the second step the third step is going to be to Source right and this is when you actually get the content that you need in order to put the ad together because if you just have a script you need to match that with video or image content using either AI or using actual real content out on the internet in order to create your high converting ad and then after you have all those pieces you just want to put it all together and actually edit the ad to Perfection and if you want to add a little bonus step here it's just a freaking scale like as soon as you have that winning ad you start to see some good data spend more money run more ads so I'm going to walk you through my entire process step byep over the shoulder so you can see what I'm personally doing with me and my team just to pump out you know 20 30 creatives minimum per week per Drop Shipping business that I'm currently running right now so let's start with step number one which is swipe the whole purpose of swiping is to find something that's already converting so that you can model it and to create your own script from it and so the criteria that you really want to look for is number one you want to make sure that the brand that you're actually modeling is doing at least like 300,000 visits per month to their website this means that the brand is validated the product is validated the market is validated and most importantly the ad is validated now in order to find how many visits a brand is doing per month you can use an extension like similar web what I got right up here in order to actually prove how many visitors are visiting that store so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to hop into one of my favorite tools called get hooked it's actually a software that I've built over the past year that I use internally and you guys can get completely full access to it for free for 14 days if you just click the first link in the description all right so we're here inside of get hooked what you want to do is navigate to the explore section and you'll see over here on the left there's all of these filters that you can use so the explor section is basically like the Facebook ads library but on steroids because you can add all these filters so only find the ads that you can prove are actually winning right now so let me show you the filters that I like to use under performance you're going to select winning so that these are only the ads that are currently winning for the brands under ad format we're going to select the video under status we only want to collect ads that are still running because we don't want to find old ads that are not proven that are selling right now in this moment we want to find ads that are only running right now under Niche we're going to keep that empty runtime these ads have to be running for a minimum of 7 days next under language we're simply going to select English now under platform you want to select Facebook Instagram and Tik Tok ads I'm not interested in organic content at this point because having a piece of organic content and paid content that converts two completely separate things under start date you can leave that empty under creative usage I want to select five and what this means is how many ads in the ad Library are actually using that exact creative because if it's just one creative in the ad Library that's not really proven but if a competitor is using this ad over and over and over again you can assume that this is probably an ad that's actually getting a sufficient amount of spend next under video length I want to Select 1 to 3 minutes now again guys I'm going through these filters as this I was doing it myself you can play around with all these these are not you know hard and fast rules that you have to follow 100% of the time but these are just ones that I like to set up in order to find the best ads possible now that we have all the filters set up I'm going to just continue to scroll down this line until I see a product or a an ad that really catches my eye okay so I'm just going to spend some time scrolling here scrolling scrolling scrolling until I see one that I know for a fact is proven based off of a series of metrics and I'm going to tell you what those metrics are in just one second so this add right here by TR Spartan actually caught my eye so I'm going to click details right here and this is one of the coolest things about get hooked is that you can actually see all the details about this ad you can see the ad copy you can see the creative itself you can see um you can download the ad if you want the ad copy everything is here that you could possibly need even the transcript right so here's the full transcript of the ad now I'll just play you know the first you know 5 to 10 seconds of this ad so you guys can get an idea for what's being sold here how is it that celebrities like Elton John Kevin Cosner or Joe Buck seem to have perfect hair well into their 50s and 60s is it genetics so there's the hook right there obviously very strong because this Hook is using something called uh familiarity buys which is where you're actually referencing and leveraging The credibility of other people for your own brand because people can immediately identify with these celebrities and it just helps them understand exactly what the product is that's being sold and the problem that's being solved now this is really important another reason that I say that this ad is winning is because if you hover over right here you can see how many ads are currently active in the ad library of this competitor so in this case it's 929 current winning active ads your kpi that you're looking for here is at least 30 so in this case we're like well over 10x the kpi so this is a winning ad we can prove it and it's it's currently being spent at a high budget for this particular competitor now one of my favorite Parts about get hooked is that you can actually spy on competitors and understand exactly the top angles that they are using to be successful so let me show you how to do that what you can do is navigate over to Brand spy and I already saved this brand right here Tri Spartan and look you can see over the past few months they have tested 4,924 ads so if you're sitting back and you're like Mark I'm trying to make this Ecom thing work I can't make it work blah blah blah blah guess what you're not testing enough creative this is your competition right here tested almost 5,000 ads okay I say this constantly but the whole winning product thing it's so irrelevant if you want a competitive Advantage compete on creatives because this guy right here this brand is your competition now I'm not saying that you need to go and test 5,000 ads I'm just putting it in perspective right Drop Shipping exists this in this weird vacuum where you're just convinced that the only way to be successful is a product with that's clearly not entirely true with this brand here you can see they they've just been testing creatives like crazy and when you look at the trend of ads launch in the past four months you always want to see this going up right and if I were to draw some TR some kind of like linear regression line here they're constantly increasing the number of creatives that they are testing every single month I'm filming this on January 22nd and they filmed 1,00 ads just this month so they are clearly scaling which is a good very very good sign you can also see the top landing pages that they're sending traffic to and my personal favorite is the the hook so what you can do is you can actually see all the top hooks that this brand is currently running and how long they've been running so typically a lot of times the the hooks that have been running for a longer period of time those are the most proven and validated hooks that you can use so we're going to use all of this for inspiration in the future and if you want to see all the ads as well you can always just scroll down and see all the ads for this particular brand now at this point if we go back to our checklist right our goal was to find an ad that we can prove is currently selling at a high volume and one of the ways to do that is to make sure number one that the brand is validated itself so we want to see at least 300,000 visits per month for this particular brand so what you can do is click on any of the landing pages that this brand is running traffic to and just pop open your similar web extension you can see that number one holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like these guys are scaling incredibly aggressively they went from 41,000 visits in a single month all the way to over 600,000 visitors now you can kind of estimate like the level of Revenue that they're doing based off their visitors um it's not always a one toone like dollar to visitor ratio but typically it's anywhere from like a 0.5 to 2x ratio in terms of their monthly Revenue so these guys are clearly clearly validated the brand is is doing really well and my God are they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scaling aggressively like this is a really good sign for us because we're looking at the brands that are already validated the ads that are already validated so what I want to do is I'm actually going to go back to that ad here and I actually want to analyze this with you because when it comes to making winning ads like I said in the intro there's really three elements to a winning ad right you have the hook you have the body and you have the call to action but what most people don't talk about is actually how to create those those hooks bodies and call the actions and why they're successful in the first place and guys look if I were to put this in perspective to you the number one most impactful thing in the success of your ads is your creatives and 90% of the success of your creative it's the hook right so this right here is like 90% of your success so when it comes to like writing and creating new apps from scratch you want to put the far majority of the effort that you're putting into it on the hook that is where you should be spending your time it's like the headline of a salesletter or the lead of a vssl it's by far the most important part of the ad because if you don't get them hooked if you don't get them in in the first uh initial part of the ad you're going to lose them okay and so your job is to as aggressively as possible capture their interest capture their desire in the first you know 3 to 10ish seconds it kind of depends of the ad so let me break it down for you when it comes to making a hook right the hook is the first 3 to 5 Seconds of an ad but what most people don't realize is that there's three elements to the hook right you have the copy itself which is you know basically the script right it's typically the first one to two sentences of a winning app so the hook in this case lasts around 8 seconds okay so it's not always the first 3 to 5 Seconds of the ad but in this case it's the first 8 seconds right but that's just the copy now the second part of the hook is going to be what I call the the actual video so a lot of people call this the scroll stopper as well but the hook which is made up of these three elements it is an audio visual experience which means there's the visual aspect which is going to be the text overlay in the video that's on the screen as well as the audio which is going to be the copy portion that's actually read out loud as well as the third part of the ad which is of course the audio so this is if it's being uh you know voiced over by you know a voiceover actor or if you're using AI whatever it is these the three elements of a creative and if I were to Rite these number one most important is going to be the copy that's why right after this I'm actually going to show you how to script the ad from scratch because if you don't get the copyright if you don't get the script right everything else is going to fail even the most perfect scroll stopper like the most perfect video in the first 3 to 5 Seconds of the ad it's never going to make up for bad copy okay and again this is why we're not Reinventing the wheel we're finding a successful ad we're swiping it and then we're rewriting it based off of proven mechanisms now if the hook Hook is 90% of the success of the ad then the other 10% which again it sounds pretty crazy like 10% of the ad is like actually 90% of the actual content but the Hook is so freaking crucial guys I can't even state it enough you need to be extremely creative and aggressive with getting people's attention in that first 3 to 5 seconds I I'll show you how to do that in just a second but I just want to make sure that principal get through your head and then the other uh 10% is going to be the body of the ad followed by at the very end of course like the call the action now it's pretty difficult to mess up the call the action the body can be a little tricky but let me actually show you how to shortcut this entire process so that you can do it from scratch after you have this ad saved within get hooked what you're going to do is scroll to the very top and select use for breef so this feature basically will take an existing ad and it's actually going to walk you through the steps of rewriting the ad rewriting the transcript here as you can see to the right and using it for your specific product now very important caveat here if you're selling let's say a a beauty product right this product in this case is a you know hair growth product you do not have to swipe an ad that is like direct competition for example a lot of times I find like new winning ads and new winning angles based off of competition in horizontal Industries horizontal markets what I mean by that is if I were selling like a pet product for example you can swipe from the health industry you can swipe from the the beauty industry you can swipe from the pain relief industry it doesn't really matter because the concepts are typically still the same in fact a lot of times I'll find new winning ads I'll create new winning ads because I'm not just obsessed with my own Market I'm willing to go outside of what everybody else is doing and actually swipe from completely different Industries I think that's a huge competitive advantage that not a lot of people do so we're going to select use for brief right here can select whatever folder you want a part of and select done now the cool part about get hooked is that it's going to take you through this whole process of rewriting this ad for your particular product now in this case I don't have a product that I'm actually trying to sell so I'm just going to make up one just a standard Drop Shipping product that you guys have probably heard before and the product that I'm going to use is going to be this poor cleaning vacuum now what I'm not going to do again because I talk about this all the time you don't want to enter like a a super saturated market and sell the same way with the same angle to the same people so in order to sell this to a different group of people I'm going to use a different angle instead of using this product to like get rid of blackheads for example I'm going to specifically Target women that are a little bit older and they're dealing with hormonal acne going through menopause so this is typically women between the ages of like 45 and 60 generally like menopause and perom menopause because a lot of women will actually get acne as they get older which is really frustrating but because of what's going on during menopause all the hormones are completely just out of whack which often times causes acne so that's a unique angle that I'm going to use for this particular product and I think it's a fantastic Market to go after all right so I just wrote a few sentences here for the product description the target onions so the brand is meno Beauty poor cleaner Pro women struggling with hormonal ACL during menopause ages 45 to 65 for the product description I would recommend writing at least three sentences here but again with AI anytime you're using it and if you want to get the best results the more data points you can give it the more inputs you can give it the better your output is going to be so I ended up writing I think around like five sentences here specifically targeting women going through menopause who are struggling with hormonal acne okay so what I'm going to do is keep the creative score rate at 7 if the cool part is like if you want to make this ad highly highly creative and get a little bit more away from the transcript you can simply adjust a slider right here but let's stick with 0.7 it's usually a good place to start and we're just going to hit WR script now while this is writing the script what it's doing is pulling the existing transcript and rewriting it based off the inputs that you gave it now the cool part here is that again you're not Reinventing the wheel you're taking a a script an ad that is already proven to convert and you're simply rewriting it with your target market and your product description in mind so as you can see that was really fast actually because typically like the longer they add the more uh time it takes but that was very very quick so we have the hook right here how is it that women like Helen Mir Michelle Obama and Jane sear have such Radiance clear skin during menopause is it magic is it expensive treatments or is it a secret they haven't yet shared right really really cool hook and if you're like uh not really fan of that hook you can just click this button right here and you have three other hooks that you can choose from I think this one is pretty good because it's referencing the exact person within our existing target market notice how it didn't say like you want to have skin like Elden sha or Kevin ker because that obviously would not Market the Avatar that we're going after but here it kept it the exact same and same thing with the body here well most of all are left battling with stubborn acting and uneven skin you might have notice that some women appearing everything okay I'm not going to read the entire thing but as you can see it rewrote the entire script and that took maybe you know 20 or 30 seconds to go through the whole thing so this is super super awesome it's a really fast tool and if at any point if you don't like anything even the hooks you can just hit regenerate and it'll recreate the body based off the inputs that you already gave it so if there's ever point where you don't like how the ad sounds or the script you can simply regenerate it and it'll take another probably 20 well never mind it goes as fast as that and the cool part is like I said here there's this create creative score section here so if you want to make an ad more creative and you want to deviate more so from the input that you gave it you can simply slide this slider up right so let's test it out at a 1.0 instead of at a 7 and you'll notice it'll get more creative it'll Venture away from the existing script that we gave it in the first place so as you can see the hook is now just a little bit different right it's not mentioning those specific characters like that initial one did I actually like the original one better so I'm going to bring that right back to 0.7 I really love the idea of referencing celebrities that our target market also looks up to cuz you're basically creating this feeling inside the prospect of status because they now comparing themselves to these figures that are the people that they really look up to all right so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to copy this entire script and throw it into a little Google doc so I can see it all together and read it out loud all right so now we have the full uh transcript right here now you'll notice Mark holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is like a pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] long script and yeah that's because it's modeling the example that we gave it if we inputed you know 45C ad script as a swipe then it's going to do the exact same thing but with a 45C ad in this case this was more so of a vssl ad right it ended up being around 2 minutes but now we have the full transcript right here now there's a really really important step here that I want you to to keep in mind anytime that like if you were to go learn copywriting from some of the best copywriters in history what they'll tell you is that actually writing copy is typically the easy part right it's all like the creative side of your brain the right side of your brain and you're just kind of flowing onto the paper what they what they really emphasize is that the real work is done in the copy chiefing and the copy chiefing is a process of reading the copy out loud over and over and over again and what I do is I actually take this copy and I put it in like 11 labs and I'll hear the AI read it out loud and what you'll notice is there going to be there's going to be specific parts of that ad that just don't really flow very well and so I would repeat this process like three to five times read it out loud have ai read it out loud to you and you'll be able to pick out a few points that the copy isn't really as as smooth as you want it to be the copy that you're writing it should basically represent like a slippery slide right it's just flowing from one to the next there's no bumps in the slide it's just naturally flowing off the tongue that's what you want with the chiefing process if you guys want like a full document on how I recommend that you Chief copy you can just DM me the word chief on Instagram my Instagram is @ Mark builds Brands and I'll send you that document for free but now that we have the full transcript now we can move on to the next step so at this point we have the swipe and we wrote the script and what I would also highly recommend you do before we move on to the source step is you always want to test with at least three different hooks like I said the hook is typically the part of the ad that that has the most amount of power right 90% of your success so when you're testing ads on Facebook or on Tik Tok you don't want to just test with one you want to test with a minimum of three and the biggest variable in your success of a creative is what the hook so you want to test with uh the same body in CTA but with three separate Hooks and so I would just take those three hooks that um that get hooked gave me and makes three separate ads for that so that when you test you can kind of test three different angles so now we're going to move on to step number three which is actually sourcing the content for this particular ad now to actually grab the content for the the ad right you have the script now you just need to get the content in place before you edit it what I highly recommend you do is use a combination of three different types of content okay the first type of content is going to be AI ugc now the reason I say AI is because it's super super cheap and you can basically tell AI to speak whatever you want out loud to you and if you use the right tool there's basically no distinguishment between the AI Avatar in a real Avatar and even if there is you know you're kind of like oh I can kind of tell it's AI that doesn't mean that you shouldn't test it I see a lot of ads right now that are running with AI avatars that are scaling like crazy that you can tell like if you look close enough you can tell okay obviously that that's AI so don't immediately discredit it because it doesn't look one toone human still test it and if you're really really worried you can simply go to Fiverr instead and just hire somebody to speak your script out loud and pay for ugc content and it'll maybe cost you like I don't know 50 to 100 bucks per script it's very very cheap but it also depends on how long the script is itself the second type of content you want to use is going to be b-roll now b-roll is basically uh copyright free content that is going to go in between the AI ugc that you already created so my favorite place to go to to get this Boll content is grid bank now full transparency I have no relationship with these guys I just like their their platform and I think you can get a lot of really good content from it and so you can search this this platform for example for in this case like we're running skincare products you can just search like skincare for example and immediately you have all these pieces of content that you can use completely free copyright free and you know it's it's not super expensive right it's just something that you have an unlimited access to your other option for the b-roll is to Simply search on internet for for copyright free b-roll that you can use in your ad so that's going to be the second type of content that you can source and then the third and final piece of content that you want to have in your ad is going to be actual product b-roll so this is going to be uh content that is actually with the product like people holding the product filming with the product and typically what you can do is you can Source this on the internet just make sure that you have the permission to use the content or same concept is above you can just ship the product to somebody on Fiverr and they can film all types of content with it now this is always the the method that I recommend people start with because like I said one of the first rules that I said in this video is you don't want to rip [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you don't want to rip people's ads because number one I believe that anything that you do in the world is going to come back to you right the universe is a mirror reflection and whatever you put out is exactly what you're going to get back so if you rip somebody they're going to come and rip you and typically it's just a zero some game like you're not going to end up in a good spot so I always recommend going the route of custom content typically from scratch and as you can see like you can do it for very cheap all of this will cost you at you know Max like 1 to 300 bucks to get your first ad test done plus often times what works really really well is you just order the product yourself and fill up some content with it I mean the amount of tools that you can do this with is insane but just go to Amazon buy the unbranded version of the product and take photos take videos have your family take photos and videos and you can get all that done for basically nothing all you need to do is have an iPhone with a reasonably good camera and you can make all this content yourself now one other thing if you guys were wondering what AI ugc service to use this is another thing that we recently built in to get hooked so what you can do if you navigate over to the left here you can select ugc AI video and what you can do is you hit generate new AI video up at the top and you can follow this process step by step you're going to paste in your script you're going to paste in any content that you have and it's literally going to put together the full ad for you now in my experience it's not going to get the ad to like 100% like it's ready to throw in the ads manager and start scaling but what I would do is just get the Raw AI ugc content so you can piece it together in the exact way that you want you can edit the clips yourself or send it to an editor but this is a fantastic tool in order to get the AI UVC content so that you can put together the best ad possible all right back to our list here we now have the swipe we have the script we have the source content all that's left at this point is to Simply edit all the content together now with this step there's really two options right you can go the free route in which case I would recommend downloading cap cut for desktop and you can piece together all this content yourself just keep keep in mind you want to model what's already working so I would go back to that swipe that we saved look at the specific uh clips that they're using in order to put together the content and model it I'm not saying swipe at one to one but model it right take the philosophy take the why why is that specific uh you know clip converting why is this particular style of AD text converting and you want to use that when it comes to creating your ad now what I like to do because you know obviously I'm not going to spend my time editing ads I have a team to do it for me is I'll have my team do it but obviously I know a lot of people watching this video you don't have a team yet and that's okay if you want to go the paid route however same concept as normal you can just gather all gather the script gather all all the b-roll all the sort content that you have and just go to Fiverr and find somebody to do this for you for like 100 bucks so you can simply go to Fiverr search something like Drop Shipping video ad and what I would highly recommend as you can see a lot of the ads that you see on this screen here just that they use as example they're so super spammy and they're probably just going to Source content themselves I would vow to just try to find a good editor period I really believe that right now the more minimalistic ads and actually less edited ads are the ones that are performing best so the closer that you can get to that raw content just with some basic cuts and captions that's a fantastic place to start you don't have to go overboard with the editing like these emojis and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this is super super old in like 2018 type Drop Shipping videos it's not what I'd recommend keep it simple okay you want to have a really you a really good script which you already wrote you want to have a really good scroll stop that first video that you're using it shouldn't just be like shocking to the point where you're just sucked in to continue watching it and then have some AI voice over it's really as simple as that and so now guys what I'm going to do is a special treat I'm actually going to send this script here that we wrote together inside of get hooked I'm going to send this to my team along with the source content that I found for this particular product and I'm going to put together an entire ad as if I was actually doing it myself so I'm going to fast forward to that point and actually show you the ultimate finished version of this ad so that we can look at it together how do women like Helen mirin or Oprah

if you want to get access just click the first link in the description and you can get 14 days free the final note that I want to leave you guys with about testing creatives is that a lot of times it is so easy for you to you know go put their you know all this work of finding the ad swiping it writing the script putting together the editing and actually testing the ad and then guess what it doesn't work and I'm here to tell you it's all part of the process it's part of the game and that's why you can use tools like get hooked just increase the volume of creatives that you're actually testing because yes you're one product away from completely changing your life but you're also one creative away you're one ad away that's why my whole Credo is run more ads all it takes is one ad to change your life so even if you do a test you want to do what right even if you lose money you're not really losing money cuz you're buying data okay so run the ads get the data and then make adjustments maybe one angle is converting better than another and so you double down on that angle and create some new Hooks and variations based off the angle that was proven to convert based off of the ad data that you spent I hope you guys really enjoyed this video if you have any questions about this process just drop them in the comments I'll do my best to answer just about every single
